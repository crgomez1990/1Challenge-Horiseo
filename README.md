#Horiseo

This project was first giving to me very unorganized with alot of div classes but no information to determine what was the body, parts of the body, what creates the body in it's code. 

First proceeded by adding a title to the webpage and what define what the compnay does. 
Horiseo - Helping Your Company with search engine optimization and marketing.

Second proceeded by adding a all the elements necessary to understand the webpage. Body, header, main, the aside, the section's and footer.

Third, proceed to fix search engine optimization link in header because it was not working.
  
Last, proceed to clean css files by combining repeating commands so it looks cleaner and defines what the css is doing to the html.
